# Setting up Comic Project

- Make sure you have python installed. Scroll down to bottom of [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3910/) and select the one according to your operating system
- Install required libraries by opening a command prompt (if you are on windows) or a terminal (if you are on Linux or MacOS) by typing following commands. Try with `pip3` if `pip` gives and error.

```bash
pip install patoolib
pip install PySimpleGUI
pip install Pillow
pip install zipfile
pip install rarfile
```

- After all commands pass successfully, run the program by going into root directory of the project, opening a command prompt and typing `python script.py`
